# Comparison between Hive Managed Tables and External Tables

When working with Hive, there are two main types of tables that can be used to store and manage data: Managed tables and External tables. While both table types have their advantages and disadvantages, understanding the differences between them can help you choose the right table type for your use case. In this README.md file, we will compare Hive Managed Tables and External Tables.

## Hive Managed Tables

Managed tables are the default table type in Hive. When a managed table is created, Hive assumes full control over the table and its data. The data is stored in a directory managed by Hive in HDFS or other storage systems. The metadata of the table, such as the schema and table properties, is also stored in the Hive Metastore. 

### Advantages of Managed Tables

- **Full Control**: Hive has full control over the table and its data, which allows for more flexibility when managing and manipulating the data.
- **Easy to Manage**: Because Hive manages both the data and metadata, it's easy to create, modify, and delete managed tables in Hive.
- **Better Performance**: Managed tables typically have better performance than external tables because Hive has more control over the data and can optimize queries more effectively.

### Disadvantages of Managed Tables

- **Data Replication**: When using managed tables, the data is stored in the Hive warehouse, which can lead to data replication if the same data is used in multiple tables.
- **Limited Compatibility**: Managed tables are limited to Hive, which means that they may not be compatible with other tools and systems.

## External Tables

External tables are similar to managed tables, but the data is stored outside of the Hive data warehouse. Instead, external tables point to data that is stored in an external location, such as HDFS or S3. When an external table is created, Hive only manages the metadata of the table, such as the schema and table properties. This allows external tables to reference data that is created and managed by other tools, such as Spark or Pig.

### Advantages of External Tables

- **Data Independence**: Because external tables only reference data, and do not manage it, the data can be used by other tools and systems without the risk of data replication.
- **Easier Data Integration**: External tables can be used to integrate data from multiple sources, as long as the data can be accessed by the external storage system.
- **Better Compatibility**: External tables are more compatible with other tools and systems, which means that they can be used in a wider range of use cases.

### Disadvantages of External Tables

- **Less Control**: Because external tables do not manage the data, there is less control over the data and how it is used and manipulated.
- **Slower Performance**: External tables may have slower performance than managed tables because they rely on external storage systems, which may be slower than local storage.

## Conclusion

Managed tables and external tables both have their advantages and disadvantages. Managed tables are easier to manage and typically have better performance, but they may be limited to use with Hive and can lead to data replication. External tables, on the other hand, offer greater compatibility and independence, but may have slower performance and less control over the data. Choosing the right table type depends on your use case and the specific requirements of your data management system.
